## Introduction

My Project is about solving 1st Order Linear Ordinary Differential Equations(ODE) using numerical methods like Euler Methods and Runge Kutta Methods and present a plot of the solution to the user or save the solution to a csv file. In this project I'm mainly considering linear 1st order ODE which is  time-invarient.

Most of the physical systems can be represented or can be approximated to represent a linear time invarient (LTI) system of 1st order ODE (For example a simple RL circuit or a Mass-Damper System). The following shows the type of equation which is going to be solved by application.

**Equation:**

In the above equation the *x(t)* is state variable of the system and *A* and *B* are constants and *u(t)* is the external input to the system.



## Research

Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations are methods used to find numerical approximations to the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Their use is also known as *numerical integration*, although this term can also refer to the computation of integrals.

Many differential equations cannot be solved using symbolic computation (*analysis*). For practical purposes, however – such as in engineering – a numeric approximation to the solution is often sufficient.
Ordinary differential equations occur in many scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. In addition, some methods in numerical partial differential equations convert the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation, which must then be solved.

## 4W's and 1H's

### Who:

This can be used by electical engineers, control system engineers, mechanical engineers or students or anybody who wants an approximate solution to 1st Order Linear ODE.

### What:

This is an application that takes a specific ODE with all its parameters, solution limits and step size, external input and returns a solution in the form of a csv file or plot or both. 

### When:

Whenever an approximate solution for 1st order linear ODE is required or fast solution is required or when the user wants to visualize the solution this application is quite useful.

### Where:
